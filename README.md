## Notes

This project took me around 10 hours start to (hopefully) finish. The biggest challenge for me was trying to get accurate framerates using the starter project on the Oculus Rift. I tried building this with the profiler enabled, but the result was terrible--there was a very noticeable delay and the camera and controllers were not tracking properly.  I'm not sure how to make sense of that since the builds seemed to work just fine if I didn't do a dev build and connect the profiler.

My favorite part of this project was just doing a bit of sleuthing and trying to figure out what to optimize. I'm trying to get better w/ c# coding so having to look through the simple scripts being used and make small mods was fun and helpful.

Thanks!
Kai Evenson
